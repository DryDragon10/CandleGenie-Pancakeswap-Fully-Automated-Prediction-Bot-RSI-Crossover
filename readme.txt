I recommend formulating and testing your own strategies with a lower balance before increasing to the amount you want to bet with.

Lower timeframe rsi is the fast line and the higher timeframe rsi is the slow line.

I personally use the 1m, 3m and 5m for my
strategies. However, I recommend using a larger timeframe set trend. i.e. (rsi3value > 50) meaning when the higher timeframe rsi is above 50.

RSI > 50 bullish
RSI < 50 bearish

One rsi can be used if needed.

lower timeframe rsi is known as the fast rsi, this will be the one crossing above or below the rsi2 or rsi3.(slow rsi)
